<p class="text"> To the most loving wife and mother: you're our superstar! 
    We love you and are so blessed to have you in our life, to love us and care for us unconditionally.
    Every waking day puts a smile on our faces, to know that we have you in our lives.
    Although our week is filled with cries, you always know how to make us feel better, to comfort and fill our hearts again. 
    We want you know to know that without you, it is simply not complete, and that our laughter and smiles 
    won't be possible withoutour awesome wife and mommy to the two banies at home!
